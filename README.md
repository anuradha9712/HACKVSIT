## Cities are currently facing high pollution rates because of rapid change in climate. An individual is unaware of how much pollution he or she is exposing by being in contact with polluted air. We are aiming to make a user friendly android application named "Pollution Prevention System". Due to high rise in use of Smart phones, sensors embedded into them will be used to detect temperature, humidity, CO level etc. 

So, basically our main aim is :
- How environment affect human health, and,
- how human's everyday activities affect environment.

This application will find out area wise pollution level details. Using this data we will gain certain insights, given below,
- One of the feature will be, that the user will enter the source and destination, and thereafter, this app will suggest the best route which will be the route having least pollution.
- Another insight is, the areas are divided into three categories, named, High, Moderate, and low polluted areas. Using this information, various methods can be used to reduce the pollution in highly affected area.
- We will also predict the health risk using the details obtained above.

This App will also detect the pollution caused by human's everyday activities (like phone_usage_time, car_usage_time) and after all the daily activities our App will give score to the user and they can challenge their friends to improve their rank on scoreboard.
